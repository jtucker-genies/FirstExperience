## First Experience

### Project to test out the Genies Experience SDK

Rather light project for now to look at basic functionality like creating/instantiating prefabs, using typescript, editing UI and the scene, etc. 

Will develop more features over time with the goal of making this a more defined 'game.'

Sypnosis to implement:
- beat rhythm game where you have to tap blocks at the correct time
- the pitch, speed, and placement of blocks will depend on the user's top trait
- blocks, pitches, and rhythms will be generated in real time
- the art will not look as terrible as it does now
